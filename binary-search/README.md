# Implementation of algorithms for searching and checking prime numbers

Implementation of algorithm for binary search (dichotomy)
Returns the boolean value of whether an element was found in the array during O(logN)

The plans are to add a method that returns the index of the found element and write a binary module for nodejs in the c language to quickly sort a number array with the number of elements more than 10000000

## Usage

For run example

```sh
npm start OR yarn start
```

For run tests

```sh
npm test OR yarn test
```
